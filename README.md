**Cloud Monitoring Add-on for Kubernetes with AWS EKS**  

This repository contains an extension to a broader cloud infrastructure project. It focuses on deploying a Python-based cloud monitoring application on Kubernetes, leveraging Docker for containerization and AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) for orchestration. Designed as an add-on, it integrates seamlessly with larger cloud-native systems to enhance scalability and reliability.  

---  

## **Overview**  
This repository serves as a modular addition to a comprehensive cloud infrastructure solution. The add-on demonstrates how to build and deploy a Python application using Docker and Kubernetes, optimized for AWS EKS environments. By incorporating this module, developers can implement a robust foundation for scalable, cloud-based monitoring services within larger projects.  

---  

## **Project Structure**  
- **`app.py`**: Implements the core functionality of the monitoring application, acting as the primary entry point.  
- **`eks.py`**: Provides automation for managing AWS EKS resources, facilitating efficient Kubernetes cluster operations.  
- **`Dockerfile`**: Defines the application’s Docker image, including runtime settings, dependencies, and build instructions.  
- **`deployment.yaml`**: Kubernetes deployment configuration specifying pod replicas, resource allocations, and other deployment parameters.  
- **`service.yaml`**: Configures a Kubernetes service to expose the application, enabling external communication or interaction with other services.  
- **`requirements.txt`**: Lists Python dependencies required for consistent execution across environments.  

---  

## **Prerequisites**  
To use this add-on, you’ll need:  
- Docker  
- Kubernetes CLI (`kubectl`)  
- AWS CLI, configured with access credentials  
- Python 3.x

## **Installation and Deployment**  

1. **Clone the repository**:  
   ```bash  
   git clone <repository-url>  
   cd <repository-folder>  
   ```  

2. **Build the Docker image**:  
   ```bash  
   docker build -t python-app:latest .  
   ```  

3. **Deploy to Kubernetes**:  
   Apply the Kubernetes deployment and service configurations:  
   ```bash  
   kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml  
   kubectl apply -f service.yaml  
   ```  

4. **Manage AWS EKS Resources**:  
   Use the `eks.py` script to automate EKS cluster operations:  
   ```bash  
   python eks.py  
   ```

## **Usage**  
This add-on can be integrated into a larger system for cloud monitoring. Use it to deploy monitoring services accessible via configured endpoints or interfaces, providing critical insights into system performance.
